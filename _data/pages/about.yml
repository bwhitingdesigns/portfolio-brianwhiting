      review: He took a look at the old website and suggested immediate changes to bring the website's appearance current. He met and exceeded the needs of the organization.  He demonstrated a high level of quality, dependability, affordability and creativity.  The design was clean and user friendly.  He communicated with me so he could understand my vision for the website. With no hesitation I recommend Brian Whiting to get the best out of a website.  Not only did he design a beautiful, artsy website I learned a lot about web designing from Brian.

      review: We want to personally thank you for all your time and work in designing and building the new Disabled In Action website. Our old site was outdated and poorly maintained, which hindered our public image. The newly designed site is a start to energize our organization as we renew our fight for a better more accessible society.
