So as some may know that come to my blog, I have been working on a side project for a podcast in the works with some friends on Apple and Spotify lately called Idiots and a DM. This has been a nice project that I have been working on that I love to do in my spare time, but lately with an injury from a work related car accident it kinda makes it hard to keep up with production anymore.

I can't really go into the details of it right now, due to legal situations, but I can only say that I can't focus on my computer projects much because of that right now. Last episode I was able to finish myself was Chapter 3. So the next episode for Chapter 4 is being worked on by our DM Rurk at the moment to help me during this tough time right now. But I will be working on posting the future episodes, even if I have to work harder myself to make it work.

But in the meantime, keep listening, give some reviews of the episodes and give suggestions on ideas for future ideas for the crew as they work on becoming Adventure Guild leaders of their own.
