> So, it has been a minute since I have posted anything on my blog. I have been busy with life and work, but I am back to share my story of how I got to where I am today as a Web Designer and Developer.

## Life Changes

I had recently been doing some changes in my life and stopped going deep into freelancing and challenging for clients. I had to take a step back and refocus on what I wanted to do with my life and career. Since I been doing this grind for over 15 years now, I wanted to make sure I was on the right path and not just going through the motions of doing something that I could not see myself doing for the rest of my life. I had to make sure that I was in the right place and doing what I loved to do. But on top of that, I had to also make sure I was doing it for my family and not just for me.

Rcently I have been married for a year and kids starting to all get into school. So, I had to pull back a bit and focus on them with working a regular job for now to get stability going. Along with applying for some studios and not getting any bites. That was a damper on my spirits and had me questioning my skills if I was good enough to be apart of a team. Now I am back and ready to work on my craft and with a custom PC that I built for myself that can handle anything I throw at it. I am ready to get back into it.

With a custom built PC that I can use for building new websites and designs this is going to be a nice change. So, now we will be getting back down to the things I have been wanting to do and be a web developer and designer like I used to be.
