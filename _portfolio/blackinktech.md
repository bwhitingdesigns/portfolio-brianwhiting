Black Ink Tech was a studio that I worked for helping to make some websites, manage DNS, and social media images. A tech startup that started back in 2019 and currently specialize in blockchain technology. While working for the company I helped with handling a few of their websites: [Sportafi](https://www.sportafi.com), [ArtLock](https://www.artlock.com/), [Park and Walk](https://www.parkandwalk.com/), [Sources to Courses](https://www.sourcestocourses.com/), [Scientia Potentia EST.](https://www.scientiapotentiaest.com/), and their company website. I helped with content management for the following websites: Park and Walk, [AnytimeCash](https://www.anytimecash.com/), [PairedPharma](https://www.pairedpharma.com/), and [SiteSUPER](https://www.sitesuper.com/).

This company was a fun experience and full remote employment. I handled the basic tasks but then expanded into DNS management to help with e-mail platforms and connecting sites to the multitude of domain names that they have under their disposal.
