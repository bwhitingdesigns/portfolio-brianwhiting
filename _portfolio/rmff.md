I create videos for a local gym now that specialize in their gym trainers, clients, and doing different graphics for their social media needs. Working with them I have made a few videos that showcase them and made some great exposure on short videos and some average video lengths.

You can see the rest of their videos that I have made [here](https://www.facebook.com/rmflexfitness/videos/).
